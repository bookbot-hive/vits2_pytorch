en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_151.wav|en-AU-Zak|they all want it to be their new home .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_152.wav|en-AU-Zak|they have to make it to the tree so that he can save his brother .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_153.wav|en-AU-Zak|so it seems there really is just one me .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_154.wav|en-AU-Zak|it would be a good spot to hide in .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_155.wav|en-AU-Zak|he must still find out what his cat likes .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_156.wav|en-AU-Zak|it is not good to let food go to waste .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_157.wav|en-AU-Zak|he cannot wait until the moon is in the right spot for him to show it his new cap .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_158.wav|en-AU-Zak|they will not have the same finery on their bodies when they come out .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_159.wav|en-AU-Zak|tim says that he finds them all hard because the teacher goes so fast .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_16.wav|en-AU-Zak|her mum is so proud that she gave the sea a try .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_160.wav|en-AU-Zak|he takes his elephant over to the tree and jumps up onto another branch .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_161.wav|en-AU-Zak|we want to do something to teach him a lesson .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_162.wav|en-AU-Zak|soon there is a strong pong in the house .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_163.wav|en-AU-Zak|he can rest here and the fish will help to get him on the mend .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_164.wav|en-AU-Zak|anika backs off so that the eel can flee .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_165.wav|en-AU-Zak|many people believe that the best way to keep clean is to get in a big tub of water .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_166.wav|en-AU-Zak|he digs plots with good soil so that he can pop the seeds right in when he comes back .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_167.wav|en-AU-Zak|if it gets too crazy out there , we can find a spot to hide while it pelts down .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_168.wav|en-AU-Zak|she thinks that it must be a pig because it is so smelly and all covered in mud and dirt .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_169.wav|en-AU-Zak|but it makes him happy just to see that he can have an effect on peoples lives .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_17.wav|en-AU-Zak|take some time to look at homes on the internet to get ideas .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_170.wav|en-AU-Zak|they lead him to a truck so that they can take him to the vet and check out his leg .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_171.wav|en-AU-Zak|he was lost and found a good spot to wait out the storm .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_172.wav|en-AU-Zak|you can have a good time even when there is nothing to do .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_173.wav|en-AU-Zak|there is such a lot going on in town all of the time .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_174.wav|en-AU-Zak|he had better get back home before she sees that he is gone .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_175.wav|en-AU-Zak|this is not quite what they thought their farm stay would be like .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_176.wav|en-AU-Zak|this seems like the perfect spot to bunker down for a good nap .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_177.wav|en-AU-Zak|some of us live at the back of a shop so where we work .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_178.wav|en-AU-Zak|she is so upset about the nuts that she cannot think straight .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_179.wav|en-AU-Zak|it is hard to find food when the lakebed dries up as well .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_18.wav|en-AU-Zak|i make a hot drink to warm me up when i get home .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_180.wav|en-AU-Zak|this dog does not look like it wants to be a bird mum .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_181.wav|en-AU-Zak|he is careful to blow it out when he goes to bed each night .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_182.wav|en-AU-Zak|they take it to a van so that they can fix its leg .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_183.wav|en-AU-Zak|but he tells me that he still likes it best when it is just us .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_184.wav|en-AU-Zak|he looks in the tree and around the tree and still cannot find his breakfast .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_185.wav|en-AU-Zak|i like to chat to kids that i see on my way home for supper .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_186.wav|en-AU-Zak|maybe this was going to be more of a problem than he thought .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_187.wav|en-AU-Zak|i wish that i could ride a bike and go to work with him .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_188.wav|en-AU-Zak|he sings him a nice song while he gives him a bath to get him ready .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_189.wav|en-AU-Zak|maybe he is just out to enjoy the moon on this lovely night .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_19.wav|en-AU-Zak|he get in through a window to see what he can find .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_190.wav|en-AU-Zak|i get to show off my talents while they have a great time .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_191.wav|en-AU-Zak|panha transmits a message down to the ground that she is coming back .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_192.wav|en-AU-Zak|she will chase the bug so that she can have a good look .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_193.wav|en-AU-Zak|with no food , she will have no energy to run around after them .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_194.wav|en-AU-Zak|diane wants to find a way that she can keep the world clean .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_195.wav|en-AU-Zak|they need to catch a live one and eat it on the spot .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_196.wav|en-AU-Zak|the moon is up and the spook will chase and chase when he is in the mood .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_197.wav|en-AU-Zak|a best pal tries to help you get good at things that you love .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_198.wav|en-AU-Zak|they must find a spot where they can go through their big change .

en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_2.wav|en-AU-Zak|their mum says it is good to rest so that they have the energy to do things when they need to .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_20.wav|en-AU-Zak|it is time to go home so he will not be late .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_200.wav|en-AU-Zak|the bees do not want to hang out , but zom is glad to be near them in a way that they like .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_201.wav|en-AU-Zak|she is not by the shrubs at the back .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_202.wav|en-AU-Zak|here is a job that she can do .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_203.wav|en-AU-Zak|but he was made to do big things .

en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_210.wav|en-AU-Zak|this spook is not in the mood to spook .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_211.wav|en-AU-Zak|we hide in a cave to keep dry .
en-bookbot/en-AU-Zak/en-AU-Zak_212.wav|en-AU-Zak|he will set a flame under the pot .

en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_114.wav|en-UK-Thalia|it took forever to find it because he could not see where he was going .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_115.wav|en-UK-Thalia|they put out some pails to catch the rain .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_116.wav|en-UK-Thalia|he feels like it is his job to scare .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_117.wav|en-UK-Thalia|she will need to get more to do her job .

en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_121.wav|en-UK-Thalia|now they will not have to sleep on his bed all of the time .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_122.wav|en-UK-Thalia|it is going to rain up where they live .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_123.wav|en-UK-Thalia|ren lands in a spot on mars where he can get some great rocks to bring home with him .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_124.wav|en-UK-Thalia|they walk through the town looking for a good place to have a bite to eat .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_125.wav|en-UK-Thalia|it jumps at the dog like it is prey .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_126.wav|en-UK-Thalia|i hope now that the sea will stay clean .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_127.wav|en-UK-Thalia|now there is red paint all over the cat .

en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_131.wav|en-UK-Thalia|they will show him great new things to eat .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_132.wav|en-UK-Thalia|a bird might think that they will get sick .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_133.wav|en-UK-Thalia|we need to put in the research now so that they can keep farming to provide us with enough food .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_134.wav|en-UK-Thalia|there is not much water left in the creek .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_135.wav|en-UK-Thalia|if we do not pick them in time , the insects will get to them .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_136.wav|en-UK-Thalia|we should find who put the trash in the lake .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_137.wav|en-UK-Thalia|there must be a way to cook in a pinch .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_138.wav|en-UK-Thalia|crow is in the treetops all by himself now .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_139.wav|en-UK-Thalia|he may be off to town to get his mail .

en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_141.wav|en-UK-Thalia|now he cannot find his way back home .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_142.wav|en-UK-Thalia|they still have a long way to go home .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_143.wav|en-UK-Thalia|we dig down in the mud so that we can rest until the rain comes .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_144.wav|en-UK-Thalia|they want me to do it again next week .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_145.wav|en-UK-Thalia|lila takes a break so that she can think .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_146.wav|en-UK-Thalia|nip feels like they might have something in common .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_147.wav|en-UK-Thalia|i am so glad that i have a mum and dad to help me get through everything in my day .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_148.wav|en-UK-Thalia|she is so glad to have a dog pal .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_149.wav|en-UK-Thalia|our goal is to grow all that we eat .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_15.wav|en-UK-Thalia|said a few others as they began to pick up the fish .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_150.wav|en-UK-Thalia|it will seem like we can spread it to kids who are near us .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_151.wav|en-UK-Thalia|they all want it to be their new home .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_152.wav|en-UK-Thalia|they have to make it to the tree so that he can save his brother .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_153.wav|en-UK-Thalia|so it seems there really is just one me .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_154.wav|en-UK-Thalia|it would be a good spot to hide in .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_155.wav|en-UK-Thalia|he must still find out what his cat likes .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_156.wav|en-UK-Thalia|it is not good to let food go to waste .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_157.wav|en-UK-Thalia|he cannot wait until the moon is in the right spot for him to show it his new cap .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_158.wav|en-UK-Thalia|they will not have the same finery on their bodies when they come out .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_159.wav|en-UK-Thalia|tim says that he finds them all hard because the teacher goes so fast .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_16.wav|en-UK-Thalia|her mum is so proud that she gave the sea a try .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_160.wav|en-UK-Thalia|he takes his elephant over to the tree and jumps up onto another branch .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_161.wav|en-UK-Thalia|we want to do something to teach him a lesson .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_162.wav|en-UK-Thalia|soon there is a strong pong in the house .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_163.wav|en-UK-Thalia|he can rest here and the fish will help to get him on the mend .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_164.wav|en-UK-Thalia|anika backs off so that the eel can flee .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_165.wav|en-UK-Thalia|many people believe that the best way to keep clean is to get in a big tub of water .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_166.wav|en-UK-Thalia|he digs plots with good soil so that he can pop the seeds right in when he comes back .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_167.wav|en-UK-Thalia|if it gets too crazy out there , we can find a spot to hide while it pelts down .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_168.wav|en-UK-Thalia|she thinks that it must be a pig because it is so smelly and all covered in mud and dirt .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_169.wav|en-UK-Thalia|but it makes him happy just to see that he can have an effect on peoples lives .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_17.wav|en-UK-Thalia|take some time to look at homes on the internet to get ideas .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_170.wav|en-UK-Thalia|they lead him to a truck so that they can take him to the vet and check out his leg .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_171.wav|en-UK-Thalia|he was lost and found a good spot to wait out the storm .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_172.wav|en-UK-Thalia|you can have a good time even when there is nothing to do .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_173.wav|en-UK-Thalia|there is such a lot going on in town all of the time .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_174.wav|en-UK-Thalia|he had better get back home before she sees that he is gone .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_175.wav|en-UK-Thalia|this is not quite what they thought their farm stay would be like .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_176.wav|en-UK-Thalia|this seems like the perfect spot to bunker down for a good nap .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_177.wav|en-UK-Thalia|some of us live at the back of a shop so where we work .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_178.wav|en-UK-Thalia|she is so upset about the nuts that she cannot think straight .

en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_18.wav|en-UK-Thalia|i make a hot drink to warm me up when i get home .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_180.wav|en-UK-Thalia|this dog does not look like it wants to be a bird mum .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_181.wav|en-UK-Thalia|he is careful to blow it out when he goes to bed each night .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_182.wav|en-UK-Thalia|they take it to a van so that they can fix its leg .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_183.wav|en-UK-Thalia|but he tells me that he still likes it best when it is just us .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_184.wav|en-UK-Thalia|he looks in the tree and around the tree and still cannot find his breakfast .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_185.wav|en-UK-Thalia|i like to chat to kids that i see on my way home for supper .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_186.wav|en-UK-Thalia|maybe this was going to be more of a problem than he thought .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_187.wav|en-UK-Thalia|i wish that i could ride a bike and go to work with him .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_188.wav|en-UK-Thalia|he sings him a nice song while he gives him a bath to get him ready .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_189.wav|en-UK-Thalia|maybe he is just out to enjoy the moon on this lovely night .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_19.wav|en-UK-Thalia|he get in through a window to see what he can find .
en-bookbot/en-UK-Thalia/en-UK-Thalia_190.wav|en-UK-Thalia|i get to show off my talents while they have a great time .

en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_152.wav|en-US-Madison|they have to make it to the tree so that he can save his brother .

en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_154.wav|en-US-Madison|it would be a good spot to hide in .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_155.wav|en-US-Madison|he must still find out what his cat likes .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_156.wav|en-US-Madison|it is not good to let food go to waste .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_157.wav|en-US-Madison|he cannot wait until the moon is in the right spot for him to show it his new cap .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_158.wav|en-US-Madison|they will not have the same finery on their bodies when they come out .

en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_162.wav|en-US-Madison|soon there is a strong pong in the house .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_163.wav|en-US-Madison|he can rest here and the fish will help to get him on the mend .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_164.wav|en-US-Madison|anika backs off so that the eel can flee .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_165.wav|en-US-Madison|many people believe that the best way to keep clean is to get in a big tub of water .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_166.wav|en-US-Madison|he digs plots with good soil so that he can pop the seeds right in when he comes back .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_167.wav|en-US-Madison|if it gets too crazy out there , we can find a spot to hide while it pelts down .

en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_169.wav|en-US-Madison|but it makes him happy just to see that he can have an effect on peoples lives .

en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_170.wav|en-US-Madison|they lead him to a truck so that they can take him to the vet and check out his leg .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_171.wav|en-US-Madison|he was lost and found a good spot to wait out the storm .

en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_175.wav|en-US-Madison|this is not quite what they thought their farm stay would be like .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_176.wav|en-US-Madison|this seems like the perfect spot to bunker down for a good nap .

en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_181.wav|en-US-Madison|he is careful to blow it out when he goes to bed each night .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_182.wav|en-US-Madison|they take it to a van so that they can fix its leg .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_183.wav|en-US-Madison|but he tells me that he still likes it best when it is just us .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_184.wav|en-US-Madison|he looks in the tree and around the tree and still cannot find his breakfast .
en-bookbot/en-US-Madison/en-US-Madison_185.wav|en-US-Madison|i like to chat to kids that i see on my way home for supper .
